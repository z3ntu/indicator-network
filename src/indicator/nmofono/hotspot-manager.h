 /**
 * HotspotManager API
 * ==============================
 *
 * Methods
 *
 * Signals
 *   enabledChanged(bool enabled)
 *     Signal that gets emitted when the hotspot is disabled or enabled.
 *
 *   storedChanged(bool stored)
 *     Signal that gets emitted when a hotspot was stored.
 *
 *   ssidChanged(QByteArray ssid)
 *     Signal that gets emitted when the ssid of the hotspot was changed.
 *
 *   passwordChanged(QString password)
 *     Signal that gets emitted when the password of the hotspot was changed.
 *
 *   modeChanged(QString mode)
 *     Signal that gets emitted when the mode was changed.
 *
 *   authChanged(QString auth)
 *
 *   Note that none of these signal will be emitted if a change to the hotspot
 *   was made by anyone else than the HotspotManager. Right now, the canonical
 *   way to edit a hotspot, is through the hotspot manager.
 *
 *
 *   reportError(int reason)
 *     The reasons correspond to https://developer.gnome.org/
 *         NetworkManager/0.9/spec.html#type-NM_DEVICE_STATE_REASON
 *
 * Properties
 *   bool enabled [readwrite]
 *     Whether or not the hotspot is enabled.
 *
 *   bool stored [readonly]
 *     Whether or not a hotspot is known to the hotspotmanager.
 *
 *   QByteArray ssid [readwrite]
 *     The current SSID of the hotspot.
 *
 *   QString auth [readwrite]
 *     The current authentication of the hotspot. The default for this property
 *     is "wpa-psk" and is currently the only supported scheme. WEP is unsupported
 *     by design, as is no scheme at all.
 *
 *     TODO: Check/add support for wpa-eap
 *
 *   QString password [readwrite]
 *     The current Pre-Shared-Key for the hotspot. If the key is 64-characters
 *     long, it must contain only hexadecimal characters and is interpreted as a
 *     hexadecimal WPA key. Otherwise, the key must be between 8 and 63 ASCII
 *     characters and is interpreted as a WPA passphrase.
 *
 *   QString mode [readwrite, optional]
 *     The current hotspot mode. The default of this value is "ap", but can be
 *     set to "p2p" or "adhoc". "p2p" and "adhoc" is currently not fully supported.
 *
 *     TODO: Complete support for adhoc and p2p modes.
